Sales performance analysis using Power BI and Python (Superstore dataset)

# Sales Performance Dashboard

This project presents a sales performance analysis using the Superstore dataset.
The goal is to explore sales behavior, profitability, and customer segmentation
through interactive visualizations and exploratory data analysis.

## Business Problem
Retail companies generate large volumes of transactional data, but raw data alone
does not provide actionable insights. Decision-makers need clear indicators to
understand sales trends, identify top-performing products and regions, and evaluate
customer segments.

This project addresses the question:
How can sales data be analyzed to evaluate performance and support business decisions?

- Analyze overall sales and profit performance
- Identify sales trends over time
- Determine top-performing product categories and products
- Compare sales performance across regions and customer segments
